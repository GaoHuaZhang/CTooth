We strongly believe in open and **reproducible deep learning research**. Our goal is to implement an open-source **tooth volume segmentation library of state of the art 3D deep neural networks in PyTorch**.    
#### Top priorities 22-07
[Update] This [conference paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08778) has been accepted on 2022 [ICIRA](https://icira2022.org/camera-ready-submission/).
[Update] We will release our dental dataset **CTooth** and more data samples later in these two months. Please follow us and watch this Github repository for releases to be notified. 


### Datasets 

#### Classification from 2D images:
-  [COVID-CT dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13865.pdf)

-  [COVIDx dataset](https://github.com/IliasPap/COVIDNet/blob/master/README.md)

#### 3D dental segmentation dataset
- [COVID-19 CT Lung and Infection Segmentation Dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3757476#.XqgcL3Uzbmt)


## Latest features (06/2020)

- On the fly 3D total volume visualization
- Tensorboard and PyTorch 1.4+ support to track training progress
- Code cleanup and packages creation
- Offline sub-volume generation 
- Add Hyperdensenet, 3DResnet-VAE, DenseVoxelNet
- Fix mrbrains,Brats2018,Brats2019, Iseg2019, IXI,MICCAI 2019 gleason challenge dataloaders
- Add confusion matrix support for understanding training dynamics
- Some Visualizations
